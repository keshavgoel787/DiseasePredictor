"""
Streamlit frontâ€‘end for the DiseasePredictor project.

This module provides a simple web interface that lets users enter a list of
symptoms and predicts a likely disease based on the existing training data.
The underlying model is trained on the public `dataset.csv` included in the
repository.  Training happens lazily the first time the app is run to keep
startâ€‘up times reasonable.

To launch the application locally, install the dependencies listed in
``requirements.txt`` and run::

    streamlit run app.py

This will start a local server at ``http://localhost:8501`` where you can
enter symptoms separated by commas (for example, ``fever, chills, cough``) and
receive a predicted disease.  The model uses a bagâ€‘ofâ€‘words representation of
the symptom list and a random forest classifier from scikitâ€‘learn to predict
the disease label.
